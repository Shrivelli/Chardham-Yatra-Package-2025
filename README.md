# Chardham-Yatra-Package-2025: Your Ultimate Guide to a Spiritual Journey
The Chardham Yatra is one of the most revered pilgrimages in Hinduism, drawing millions of devotees annually to the sacred shrines of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath, nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. As of April 8, 2025, the yatra season is gearing up, with temples set to open around late April to early May, offering pilgrims a chance to seek divine blessings amidst breathtaking Himalayan landscapes. Whether you're a first-time pilgrim or a seasoned traveler, planning this spiritual journey can be both exciting and overwhelming. That’s where our website, dharmikparyatan, comes in—your one-stop solution for booking affordable and hassle-free Chardham Yatra tour packages tailored to your budget and preferences.
In this article, we’ll dive into the essence of the Chardham Yatra, why it’s significant, and how you can book a tour package through our platform. Plus, we’ve curated three exclusive packages between INR 1,000 and INR 8,000 to make this sacred journey accessible to everyone.

What is the Chardham Yatra?
The Chardham Yatra, often referred to as the "Chota Chardham," encompasses four holy sites in Uttarakhand:
Yamunotri: The source of the Yamuna River, dedicated to Goddess Yamuna.
Gangotri: The origin of the Ganges River, honoring Goddess Ganga.
Kedarnath: A revered Shiva temple, one of the 12 Jyotirlingas.
Badrinath: A temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, nestled between the Nar and Narayan mountain ranges.
Traditionally undertaken from west to east (Yamunotri to Badrinath), this pilgrimage is believed to cleanse sins and pave the way to spiritual liberation. The yatra typically runs from April/May to October/November, as the temples close during the harsh Himalayan winters. In 2025, tentative opening dates are:
Yamunotri and Gangotri: April 30
Kedarnath: May 4
Badrinath: May 4
These dates may shift slightly, so stay updated via dharmik paryatan, where we provide real-time announcements and travel advisories.
